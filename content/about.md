Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

My name is Atul Acharya; I'm a maker and builder of things, and I love learning.

This site exists primarily to document my own learning adventures over the years.

## About Me

One word that describes me: _Curious_. Two more: _Lifelong learner_. If you know me, I'm always on a quest to do or learn something new.

My view of AI is that _artificial intelligence is an augmentation tool for humans._ As such, I am completely fascinated by **applied AI, deep learning**. I like and understand the theories; however, I am more enamored by _practical use cases of deep learning_.

I keep a broad interest in applied AI, and here are a few interesting uses cases I track.

#### Applied AI Use Cases

* **Healthcare:** Medical diagnostics (radiology, skin cancer detection, diabetic retinopathy, etc.)
* **Robotics:** Self driving cars, Autonomous robots, Flying cars
* **AI on the Edge** Deep learning applications on smartphones, Raspberry Pi, and other limited-compute devices
* **Aerial:** Aerial image (satellite image analytics), drone photography/analytics
* **Creative AI:** creative arts (e.g. neural style transfer), creative music generation tools for artists and amateurs 
* **Natural Language Understanding:** Neural machine translation, language understanding


## Things I'm Learning and Building (a constantly updated list)


- **Deep Learning** -  I completed several specializations: [Deep Learning (Andrew Ng's new 5-course)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/AQEGV5ZLBS2P), [Machine Learning Specialization (from Univ. of Washington)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/8ABRKKSSM4AP), [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://confirm.udacity.com/5GN6ARGK) from Udacity, and some more. See [here for my reviews](http://atul.fyi/post/2016/03/01/on-learning-deep-learning/).

- **Autonomous Systems** - Self Driving Cars, Robotics. I completed Udacity's [Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://confirm.udacity.com/D4PF3GHQ) in 2017. I'm learning how to teach robots.

- **Mobile Apps** -  I build iOS apps and mobile experiences.

- **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning and teaching robots. 

### My brief philosophy


My (very brief) view of humanity is that what separates us from other animals is _our ability to learn_ - from our
experiences, from others, and from everything around us. Our ability to expand our potential, and to apply it to daily life. That's what drives me.

## Work 
I work on products by day, hack on deep learning projects by night, and learn continously.

A lot of my work and interests are inter-disciplinary. As such, my interests span the **big picture** -- strategy, vision, product, growth, customers -- and the **details** -- product management, design, analytics, UX. I switch between the two easily, as do I between _technology_ and _business_.

Some areas of my work are:

- Product Management: product + portfolio strategy, product concept to launch, planning/forecasting, [customer] value proposition development, roadmapping, go-to-market strategy
- Leadership: leading cross-functional teams: product, engineering, design, marketing
- Engineering: product development (software and hardware), system architecture
- Analytics: business analytics, data science

Primary areas that interest me:

- Mobile: mobile apps/services - Messaging, Ads/Analytics, Mobile Commerce/Payments
- Mobile devices: Smartphones, Tablets, Connected Devices (Wearables, Set-Top Boxes, IOT)
- Autonomous Systems: Self-Driving Cars, Robotics
- Retail Tech: Ecommerce, Analytics
