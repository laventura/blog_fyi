Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

My name is Atul Acharya; I'm a maker and builder of things, and I love learning.

This site exists primarily to document my own learning adventures over the years.
You may, or may not, find here what you came looking for. (But I'll be happy if you did.)

## About Me

One word that describes me: _Curious_. Two more: _Lifelong learner_. If you know me, I'm always on a quest to do or learn something new.

### Things I'm Learning and Building (a constantly updated list)

- **Deep Learning** -  I completed several specializations: [Deep Learning (Andrew Ng's new 5-course)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/AQEGV5ZLBS2P), [Machine Learning Specialization (from Univ. of Washington)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/8ABRKKSSM4AP), [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://confirm.udacity.com/5GN6ARGK) from Udacity, and some more. See [here for my reviews](http://atul.fyi/post/2016/03/01/on-learning-deep-learning/).

- **Autonomous Systems** - Self Driving Cars, Robotics. I completed Udacity's [Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://confirm.udacity.com/D4PF3GHQ) in 2017.

- **Mobile Apps** -  I build iOS apps (mostly for myself)

### My brief philosophy


My (very brief) view of humanity is that what separates us from other animals is _our ability to learn_ - from our
experiences, from others, and from everything around us. Our ability to expand our potential, and to apply it to daily life. That's what drives me.

### Work 

I work on products by day, hack on deep learning projects by night, and learn continously.

A lot of my work and interests are inter-disciplinary. As such, my interests span the **big picture** -- strategy, vision, product, growth, customers -- and the **details** -- product management, design, analytics, UX. I switch between the two easily, as do I between _technology_ and _business_.

Some areas of my work are:

- Product Management: product + portfolio strategy, product concept to launch, planning/forecasting, [customer] value proposition development, roadmapping, go-to-market strategy
- Leadership: leading cross-functional teams: product, engineering, design, marketing
- Engineering: product development (software and hardware), system architecture
- Analytics: business analytics, data science

Primary areas that interest me:

- Mobile: mobile apps/services - Messaging, Ads/Analytics, Mobile Commerce/Payments
- Mobile devices: Smartphones, Tablets, Connected Devices (Wearables, Set-Top Boxes, IOT)
- Autonomous Systems: Self-Driving Cars, Robotics (new)
- Retail Tech: Ecommerce, Analytics


More to come...
