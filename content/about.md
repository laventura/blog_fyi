Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

My name is Atul; I'm a maker and builder of things, and I love learning.

This site exists primarily to document my own learning adventures over the years. I learn best by doing, and things here are a (brief) reminder to myself.

You may, or may not, find here what you came looking for. (But I'll be happy if you did.)

## About Me

One word that describes me: _Curious_. Two more: _Lifelong learner_. If you know me, I'm always on a quest to learn something, new or old.

### Things I'm Learning (a constantly updated list)

* Deep Learning
* Autonomous Systems - Self Driving Cars, Robotics


### My brief philosophy


My (very brief) view of humanity is that what separates us from other animals is _our ability to learn_ - from our
experiences, from others, and from everything around us. To expand one's potential, and to apply it to daily life. That's what drives me.

### Work 

I work on product by day, hack on deep learning projects by night, and learn continously.

Key areas of my work:

- Product Management: product + portfolio strategy, product concept to launch, planning/forecasting, [customer] value proposition development, roadmapping, go-to-market strategy
- Leadership: leading cross-functional teams: product, engineering, design, marketing
- Engineering: product development (software and hardware), system architecture
- Analytics: business analytics, data science

Primary industries:

- Mobile industry: Smartphones, Tablets, Connected Devices (Wearables, Set-Top Boxes, IOT)
- Mobile services: Mobile Apps and SaaS products - Messaging, Ads/Analytics, Mobile Commerce, Mobile 
- Telecom / Networking: Infrastructure: Optical networking, switching
- Autonomous Systems

More to come...
