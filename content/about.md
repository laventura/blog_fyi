Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

My name is Atul Acharya; I'm a maker and builder of things, and I love learning.

This site exists primarily to document my own learning adventures over the years.
You may, or may not, find here what you came looking for. (But I'll be happy if you did.)

## About Me

One word that describes me: _Curious_. Two more: _Lifelong learner_. If you know me, I'm always on a quest to do or learn something, new or old.

### Things I'm Learning (a constantly updated list)

* Deep Learning
* Autonomous Systems - Self Driving Cars, Robotics


### My brief philosophy


My (very brief) view of humanity is that what separates us from other animals is _our ability to learn_ - from our
experiences, from others, and from everything around us. Our ability to expand our potential, and to apply it to daily life. That's what drives me.

### Work 

I work on products by day, hack on deep learning projects by night, and learn continously.

A lot of my work and interests are inter-disciplinary. 

Some areas of my work are:


- Product Management: product + portfolio strategy, product concept to launch, planning/forecasting, [customer] value proposition development, roadmapping, go-to-market strategy
- Leadership: leading cross-functional teams: product, engineering, design, marketing
- Engineering: product development (software and hardware), system architecture
- Analytics: business analytics, data science

Primary industries:

- Mobile industry: Smartphones, Tablets, Connected Devices (Wearables, Set-Top Boxes, IOT)
- Mobile services: Mobile Apps and SaaS products - Messaging, Ads/Analytics, Mobile Commerce, Mobile 
- Web apps and services
- Autonomous Systems (Self-Driving Cars, etc.)
- Telecom / Networking: Infrastructure: Optical networking, switching

More to come...
