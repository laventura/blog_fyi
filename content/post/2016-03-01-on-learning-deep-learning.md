I'm often asked about how to go learning about machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). This post is a (constantly updated) list of resources that _I_ have found useful. Your mileage _will vary_ by your own experience, background, motivation and expertise. I do hope you will find this useful though.

I use a combination of books and online learning (_no pun_) and offline meetups to go deep. Here are some of my favorite resources.

# Books

*1.* [_Python Machine Learning_](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition) by Sebastian Raschka [Review: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚úØ]

<blockquote>
Very readable, expects familiarity with linear algebra, calculus and Python. Very hands-on! Most algorithms are implemented from scratch. If you want to learn fundamentals, with good hands-on practice, this book is excellent. This book is about _machine learning_ though, not deep learning per se.

*2.* [_Hands-on Machine Learning with TensorFlow and Scikit Learn_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) by Aur√©lien Geron [Review: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚úØ]

<blockquote>

This is another excellent book for both machine learning and basics of deep learning. It is a slightly dense, though very readable. It goes from basics of machine learning using both scikit learn and TensorFlow framework. As such, this book is meant to be read hands-on. You really need to go through the Jupyter notebook tutorials to understand the implementations fully (and that is my chief gripe, although a minor one). Recommended! 

</blockquote>

*3.* [_Deep Learning with Python_](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff) by Fran√ßois Chollet [Review: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ]

<blockquote>

Written by the creator of the deep learning framework [Keras](https://keras.io), this is a highly readable book on deep learning. I like this one because my own philosophy matches very closely with that of Fran√ßois; like him, I believe deep learning should be made easy, jargon-free, and accessible to all, including non-PhD practitioners. Keras is a high-level framework on top of other (lower level) frameworks like TensorFlow, Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Theano (now no longer in development). It makes development of deep learning projecs _very easy_. This book is largely jargon-free, hype-free and math-free. It goes over projects you can easily implement on your own laptop (and optionally in the cloud), with difficulty going from easy to hard.
I'd highly recommend this book to anyone starting their deep learning journey!
(If you're reading this, Fran√ßois - thank you and allow me to buy you a beer or coffee and talk AI stuff. üëç )

*4.* [_Deep Learning_](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville [Review: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚úØ]

<blockquote>

This book, by three well known researchers in the deep learning community, is _the classic reference_ for deep learning! It is highly mathematical, very thorough on all the basics - linear algebra, calculus, optimization, machine learning algorithms, deep learning techniques, and more. It is exhaustive. It is also highly theoretical. It is a great book for reference, when you need to understand some pesky detail from the ground up. It is _not_ a book you would use for tinkering with projects or implementing something out of the box (your mileage will vary, of course).
I only rate it 4.5/5 stars because this book can be daunting (it is to me) with highly detailed (and sometimes scary) math symbols. If math is not for you, I'd skip this book until you get comfortable with some practice.  I'd recommend this book for reference though (which is how I use it).
