A short note to say, I completed Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The course was prepared by [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and offered on Coursera. 

Woot, woot üëçüçæ

The specialization is a set of five courses, each of which is ~3-6 weeks.

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning

2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization, and Optimization

3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects

4. Convolutional Neural Networks

5. Sequence Modeling

I liked all the courses, but in particular, I loved #3 (Structuring ML Projects) as it focused on the _big picture_ of machine learning, which is rarely covered anywhere else. And I loved #4 Convolutional Neural Networks, which has some cool and latest projects, such a neural style transfer, semantic segmentation, and more.

My thanks to [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/) and the entire team for a fresh, updated course set. The course is taught in Python with hosted Jupyter Notebooks, which is great because you don't have to use your laptop or cloud GPUs for training. That's a big win üëç

Bigger review coming...
