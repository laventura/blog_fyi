Another quick note to say that I completed the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai) from Udacity. 

Woot 🍾 🎉

I specialized in computer vision applications, an area I am totally fascinated with. Much of the brains of autonomous vehicles is built using computer vision techniques, so this was a great opportunity to work in face recognition and related apps. 

 I do plan to go deeper into _natural language processing_, and _voice UI_ over the next few weeks.

 This also came in the middle of my _other_ [deep learning specialization](http://atul.fyi/post/2018/03/12/graduated-deep-learning-specialization/), so it feels all the more valuable. 


Many thanks to the wonderful instructors at Udacity, namely [Louis Serrano](https://medium.com/@luis.serrano), [Cezanne Camacho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezanne-camacho-422823b2/), [Arpan Chakraborty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arpan-chakraborty-17688012/), and many others who developed the course, projects and videos. 🙏🏻

This was a few months of effort, right in the middle of working through the [Self Driving Car Nanodegree](http://atul.fyi/post/2017/10/22/graduated-self-driving-car-nanodegree/), so yeah. 👍

Review coming soon...

The journey continues... Onward!
