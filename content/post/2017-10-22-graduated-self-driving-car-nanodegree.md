Just a quick note to say, I've completed Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree in its inaugural cohort. 👍👍

Here's a very short GIF of my code running on Udacity's self-driving car (nicknamed Carla)

It was an amazing experince of learning over the last several months from the likes of [Sebastian Thrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun) (arguably the father of self-driving cars), [David Silver](https://medium.com/@dsilver829) (lead at SDC Nanodegree program at Udacity), many Udacity instructors, several industry experts from Mercedes Benz R&D, NVIDIA, Electic Movement, and many more, and several hundred students online!

My thanks to all of them 🙏🏻

Here's the certificate.
